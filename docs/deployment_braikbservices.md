# Deployment of BrainKB Services

BrainKB consists of multiple service components, as highlighted in the {ref}`brainkb_architecture_figure` All of the service components can be deployed independently. However, there are a few dependencies, such as setting up the PostgreSQL database that is used by JWT Users and Scope Manager, that need to be setup first. 

<b style="color:red;">Note:</b> The installation of Docker is necessary due to its use in deployment.


## Dependencies 

The following are the core dependencies: software and service components that need to be installed in the order specified below.

### JWT User & Scope Manager
The JWT User & Scope Manager helps to simplify the management of permissions and users for API endpoint access. It needs to be setup as a first step in order to use JWT based authentication. 

**Installation:**
- Navigate to APItokenmanager directory.
- Install PostgreSQL databse by running the Docker Compose file present inside _docker-postgresql_ folder.
	- **Important:** You need to create an `.env` file to hold the following information.

		- POSTGRES_USER: PostgreSQL database user name.
		- POSTGRES_PASSWORD: Password for PostgreSQL database user.
		- POSTGRES_DB: Database name.
		- PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: Email address for [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org).  
		- PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: Password for pgAdmin user.
	- Additionally, set the following environment variables in `.env` files for Django that are required to create Django superuser.
		- DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME: Username that you will use to login to JWT User & Scope Manager.
		- DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL: Email address of the user.
		- DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD: Password of the Django superuser.
- Assign the environment variables specified below and deploy the application by executing the Docker Compose file, selecting either development (`docker-compose-dev.yml`) or production (`docker-compose-prod.yml`) depending on your environemnt.
	- DB_NAME: Name of the database.
	- DB_USER: User name.
	- DB_PASSWORD: Password.
	- DB_HOST: Database connection URL, default is localhost.
	- DB_PORT: Database port number, default is 5432.

Upon successful deployment, you should following home screen as shown in {numref}`jwtuserhome` and manage users and permissions (see {numref}`jwtuserupdateinfo`).

### RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is an open-source messaging broker software that is used in the ingestion process. Other microservices, i.e., workers, then consume the data that RabbitMQ holds in the messaging queue. 

**Installation:**
- Navigate to rabbit-mq directory.
- Run the `docker-compose.yml`, issuing `docker compose up` command.
	- **Important:** You need to create an `.env` file and provide the following information.
	- RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: Username for the RabbitMQ that will be use to login.
	- RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: Password for the RabbitMQ.
- After successful deployment, you should be able to see the screen shown in {numref}`rabbitmqlogin`. Use the username and password specified earlier to login.

### GraphDB
We use GraphDB to store our KGs. 

**Installation:**
- Navigate to graphdb directory.
- Run the `docker-compose.yml`, issuing `docker compose up` command. After successful deployment, you should be able to see the following screen (see {numref}`graphdbwelcome`). 

```{figure} graphdb.png
:name: graphdbwelcome
GraphDB Screen.
``` 
- Access to the GraphDB is available to all users by default. To enable password based access, navigate to setup â†’ users and access and enable security (see {numref}`setaccesscontrol`).
