abstract="A meta-analysis is a Science of Science method widely used in the medical and social sciences to review, aggregate and quantitatively synthesise a body of studies that address the same research question. With the volume of research growing exponentially every year, conducting meta-analyses can be costly and inefficient, as a significant amount of time and human efforts needs to be spent in finding studies meeting research criteria, annotating them, and properly performing the statistical analyses to summarise the findings. In this work, we show these issues can be tackled with semantic representations and technologies, using a social science scenario as case-study. We show how the domain-specific content of research outputs can be represented and used to facilitate their search, analysis and synthesis. We present the very first representation of the domain of human cooperation, and the application we built on top of this to help experts in performing meta-analyses semi-automatically. Using few application scenarios, we show how our approach supports the various phases meta-analyses, and more in general contributes towards research replication and automated hypotheses generation.",

abstract = {Abstract Causal inference is a key step in many research endeavors in cognitive science and neuroscience, and particularly cognitive neuroscience. Statistical knowledge is sufficient for prediction and diagnosis, but causal knowledge is required for action and intervention. Most statistics courses and textbooks emphasize the difficulty of causal inference, focusing on the maxim that “correlation does not mean causation”: there can be multiple causal possibilities, often many of them, consistent with given observed statistics. This paper focuses instead on the conceptual issues and assumptions that confront causal and other kinds of inference, primarily focusing on cognitive neuroscience. We connect inference methods with goals and challenges, and provide concrete guidance about how to select appropriate tools for the scientific task.

abstract = {In this article, we provide a comprehensive introduction to knowledge graphs, which have recently garnered significant attention from both industry and academia in scenarios that require exploiting diverse, dynamic, large-scale collections of data. After some opening remarks, we motivate and contrast various graph-based data models, as well as languages used to query and validate knowledge graphs. We explain how knowledge can be represented and extracted using a combination of deductive and inductive techniques. We conclude with high-level future research directions for knowledge graphs.},
